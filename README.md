As a Business Analyst, I played a key role in the strategic launch of Walmart Fitness Club, an innovative digital wellness platform integrated into Walmart’s app and website. I collaborated cross-functionally to align product development with Walmart’s vision of promoting health and wellness. My contributions spanned requirement gathering, market research, stakeholder coordination, and delivering customer-centric fitness and nutrition services. I also helped develop project timelines, integration strategies, and performance metrics to ensure successful implementation and evaluation.

From conducting SWOT and risk assessments to shaping content strategies with fitness influencers and managing platform testing, I contributed to a full-scale product lifecycle in an Agile SDLC environment. The project aimed to drive customer engagement, revenue growth, and brand differentiation, while supporting long-term relationships and data-driven decision-making. Working on this high-impact project deepened my expertise in digital transformation, product innovation, and business analytics in the e-commerce and health tech space.
